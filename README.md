# Vehicle Management System



## Overview
The Vehicle Management System is a Java-based application that utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage different types of vehicles. The system features a `Vehicle` class as the parent class, with `Car` and `Truck` classes inheriting from it. Each class has specific attributes and methods relevant to its type, allowing for efficient vehicle management and display of information. I used ChatGPT to help me come up with a project and tasks I needed to accomplish, but didn't use it to correct or write the code for me, as that would be silly :) 

## Features
- **Vehicle Class**: The base class that defines common attributes such as `make`, `model`, `year`, `fuel type`, and `mileage`.
- **Car Class**: Inherits from `Vehicle` and includes additional properties like `trunk capacity` and `transmission type`.
- **Truck Class**: Also inherits from `Vehicle`, adding specific attributes like `cargo capacity` and whether it has a trailer.
- **Enums**: Utilizes enums for `FuelType` and `CarTransmission` to manage predefined constants effectively.

## Project Duration
This project took approximately **2 hours** to complete. This includes the design, coding, testing, and documentation phases.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout this project, I learned:
- How to implement OOP principles, including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- The importance of using enums for better code organization and readability.
- How to override methods for specific behaviors in subclasses.
- The significance of writing clear and concise documentation to make code more maintainable and understandable for others.

## Conclusion
This project has enhanced my understanding of Java and OOP concepts while allowing me to create a functional application. I look forward to expanding this project further by adding features such as a user interface or a database for persistent storage :)
